NOTES:
- when we have images in docker desktop app  each image when we run it creates container and associated 
  with it in containers tab 

- to remove and image first it should be unused and has no associated containers so container must be removed first then we can remove the image

- to create an image for release mode in vs change the debug mode to release mode and make the running profile as Docker
  then run the vs it will create and image with tag latest

Docker Components:
Registry: an environment where images are saved to be shared between teams
Image: a version from our application code to be used
Container: a small environment with all dependencies for our application which is associated with our image we already built
