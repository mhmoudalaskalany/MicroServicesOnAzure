NOTES:
- when we have images in docker desktop app  each image when we run it creates container and associated 
  with it in containers tab 
- to remove and image first it should be unused and has no associated containers so container must be removed first then we can remove the image

Commands:
1-docker images                      // listing all images
2-docker rmi image-name-lowercase    // remove images
